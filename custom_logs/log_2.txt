A new 2D Unity project was created on Unity Hub.
A video [1] about connection between Unity and GitHub, was watched.
Another Unity video tutorial was found in YouTube [2].
After watching first video, license issue for GitHub repository, was remembered and then a webpage [3] was read shortly for learning license issue but any license did not be added.
After watching 2 videos [4] [5] for examining usage of GitHub with Unity, Unity project was moved into created local GitHub repository.
Before pushing current project, "Warning: line endings will be changed from 'LF' to 'CRLF'." text was noticed on GitHub Desktop but it was ignored.
